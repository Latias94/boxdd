# Changelog

This project contains two crates:
- `boxdd`: safe, ergonomic Rust wrapper over the Box2D v3 C API
- `boxdd-sys`: low-level FFI bindings + vendored Box2D sources

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [boxdd 0.2.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- Typed user data APIs for `World`/`Body`/`Shape`/`Joint` with automatic cleanup on destroy paths.
- `CallbackWorld` and `World::set_custom_filter_with_ctx` / `World::set_pre_solve_with_ctx` to access typed user data safely from Box2D callbacks.
- `cgmath` interop for `Transform <-> cgmath::Matrix3<f32>`.
- `cgmath`/`nalgebra` tuple conversions for `Aabb`.

### Changed
- Breaking: `World::debug_draw` / `World::debug_draw_raw` are now safe APIs (the old `unsafe` call sites must be updated).
- `with_*_events_view` are safe and automatically defer destruction while borrowing Box2D event buffers.
- Docs and README wording aligned around general “math interop” (not only `mint`).
 - Dependency: `boxdd` now requires `boxdd-sys >= 0.2.1` (CI packaging fixes live in `boxdd-sys 0.2.1`).

### Fixed
- Guarded raw `unsafe with_*_events` to defer destruction while borrowing Box2D event buffers.
- Multiple stale safety notes after refactors.

## [boxdd-sys 0.2.0] - 2025-12-17

### Notes
- No upstream Box2D revision change in this release (version bump aligned with `boxdd`).

## [boxdd-sys 0.2.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- CI packaging: add `package-bin` feature and declare the internal `package` binary so `prebuilt-binaries.yml` works.
- CI runner: switch Intel macOS builds from `macos-13` (retired) to `macos-15-intel`.
