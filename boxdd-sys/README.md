boxdd-sys â€” Low-level FFI for Box2D v3 (C API)

What this crate does
- Builds the upstream Box2D v3 C sources from the git submodule under `third-party/box2d`.
- Exposes raw FFI in `boxdd_sys::ffi` generated by bindgen.
- Provides minimal math interop with `mint` (`Vector2`, `Point2`) and arrays/tuples for `b2Vec2`.

Build notes
- Ensure submodules are initialized: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- `build.rs` compiles the C sources via the `cc` crate and runs `bindgen` on headers in `include/`.
- Windows MSVC and Unix toolchains are supported. If your linker complains about language standards
  flags or C++ libs, please open an issue; Box2D v3 is pure C and should not require C++.

Docs.rs / WASM
- The crate sets basic docs.rs settings. For WASM or cross builds, ensure your environment provides
  the necessary C toolchain; otherwise, consider building on a host and vendoring prebuilt bindings.
